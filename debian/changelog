puls-g3 (0.7.1) buster; urgency=medium

  * Updated sensors tab to show all sensors correctly
  * CPU Temp monitoring now also looks into /sys/class/hwmon/*/name for k10temp, coretemp, k8temp, zenpower
  * For some reason, to access Docker containers info for monitoring requires PULS ran with "sudo". Until i find a solution to that problem users has Docker containers and wants to monitor them needed to run PULS with "sudo"
  * Some places used secondary color instead of primary color, all fixed now

puls-g3 (0.7.0) buster; urgency=medium

  * Temperatures and sensor data refresh in real-time and used on different tabs
  * NVMe health percentage, power cycle count, and disk type (NVMe/SSD/HDD) shown on Disks tab
  * Sensors tried to be grouped by category (CPU, GPU, Memory, Disk, Fan, Other) with visual temperature bars
  * Enlarged gauges with borders and temperature display in info panel
  * Temperature row added to Memory tab details, not every computer gaves this info so dont expect much
  * Styled to match service status modal (larger, consistent borders)
  * Updated bollard to v0.19, fixed legacy client errors for newer Docker APIs
  * (I hope again) Fixed 0Hz/0Usage on AMD cards with hwmon sensor fallback
  * Added sysfs hwmon fallback when component label matching fails

puls-g3 (0.6.2) buster; urgency=medium

  * Added a new feature to view Docker container logs directly in the UI (press 'l' in the containers tab)
  * Release executable PULS file now opens terminal for itself, result is working like AppImage application but executable way
  * Updated bollard to v0.19 and refactored codebase to fix legacy client errors and support newer Docker APIs
  * (I hope) Fixed 0Hz/0Usage reporting on AMD cards by implementing a fallback to hwmon sensors when legacy pp_dpm_* files are missing
  * Removed unused "add implementation later" code and parameters, resolving compiler warnings and lowering binary size
